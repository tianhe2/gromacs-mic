gromacs-mic is parallel acceleration version of molecular dynamic simulation software GROMACS. The basic version of GROMACS we use is v5.0.4. We applied three different level of optimization: we first achieve offload mode on MIC and then use both MIC and CPU on a single node, at last we achieve multi-node parallel acceleration.
